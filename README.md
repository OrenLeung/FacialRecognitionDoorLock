## SE 101 Project - Compiler Monkeys

This project was created by a team of 5 members for our SE101 class. It uses a Raspbery Pi, a Raspberry Pi Camera, a Servo and an Arduino for hardware. The Pi controls the Arduino via Serial which, in turn, controls the Servo. The PiCamera takes a picture and sends it to the server created in Flask. The server hosts the AI to run facial recognition. The server then sends a boolean response to the Pi which makes further decisions.
